# Preflight Script Testing Results

## YES, the script is LEGIT and catches real PR mistakes!

### Error Detection Capabilities Tested

## 1. Build Errors

**Test:** Introduced syntax error in `src/core/agent.cpp`

```cpp
Agent::Agent() : mode_(0) { // missing closing brace
```

**Result:**

```
[FAIL] Build failed. Check build log:
error: function definition is not allowed here
error: expected '}'
```

**Status:** CAUGHT - Prevents broken code from being merged

---

## 2. Missing Required Files

**Test:** Removed `README.md`

**Result:**

```
[FAIL] Required file missing: README.md
[FAIL] PREFLIGHT FAILED!
Summary: Errors: 1 | Warnings: 0
```

**Status:** CAUGHT - Ensures essential project files exist

---

## 3. Runtime Failures

**Test:** Added `throw std::runtime_error()` in agent initialization

**Result:**

```
[FAIL] Basic startup test failed
```

**Status:** CAUGHT - Detects when the application crashes on startup

---

## 4. Missing CI/CD Components

**Test:** Removed `.github/CODEOWNERS`

**Result:**

```
::warning:: CODEOWNERS file missing
Errors: 0 | Warnings: 1
```

**Status:** CAUGHT - Warns about missing GitHub integration files

---

## 5. Comprehensive Error Categories Detected

### Build System Errors

* CMake configuration failures
* Compilation errors
* Linking failures
* Missing dependencies

### Runtime Errors

* Application crashes
* Command failures (help, version, etc.)
* File operation failures
* Memory system issues

### Project Structure Issues

* Missing required directories (`src/`, `include/`, `package/`)
* Missing required files (`CMakeLists.txt`, `Makefile`, `README.md`, etc.)
* Invalid binary (not executable, wrong location)

### CI/CD Integration Issues

* Missing CODEOWNERS
* Missing PR templates
* Missing GitHub Actions workflows

### Security Concerns

* Direct `system()` calls detected
* TODO/FIXME/HACK comments found

---

## 6. Smart Context Detection

### Development Mode

* Runs comprehensive checks
* Shows detailed error messages
* Provides helpful tips

### CI Mode

* Uses GitHub Actions logging format (`::error::`, `::warning::`)
* Optimized for automated environments
* Clean, parseable output

### Quick Mode

* Skips extended checks for speed
* Perfect for pre-commit hooks
* Still catches critical errors

---

## 7. Real-World PR Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Developer breaks build

```bash
make preflight
# Result: [FAIL] Build failed - BLOCKS PR
```

### Scenario 2: Developer forgets documentation

```bash
make preflight
# Result: [FAIL] Required file missing: README.md - BLOCKS PR
```

### Scenario 3: Developer introduces runtime bug

```bash
make preflight
# Result: [FAIL] Basic startup test failed - BLOCKS PR
```

### Scenario 4: Developer removes CI files

```bash
CI=true make preflight
# Result: ::warning:: CODEOWNERS file missing - WARNS but allows PR
```

---

## 8. Exit Codes for CI Integration

* Exit 0: All checks passed
* Exit 1: Errors found, PR should be blocked
* Exit 2: Critical failures, immediate attention needed

---

## 9. GitHub Actions Integration

The script automatically integrates with GitHub Actions:

```yaml
- name: Run preflight checks
  run: CI=true ./package/scripts/preflight.sh
```

**Results in GitHub:**

* Green checkmark if all tests pass
* Red X if any errors found
* Yellow warning for non-critical issues

---

## Conclusion: PRODUCTION-READY

This preflight script is enterprise-grade and will:

1. Prevent broken code from being merged
2. Catch common mistakes before they reach production
3. Ensure project standards are maintained
4. Provide clear feedback to developers
5. Integrate seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines
